# Stock Price Prediction Using RNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance and evaluates its performance using various metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

## Data Collection
Data for this project is collected from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. The historical stock price data includes features such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume.

### Example Code to Fetch Data
```python
import yfinance as yf

# Download stock data
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2010-01-01', end='2022-01-01')
```

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aashish-thapa/Stock-Prediction-Model.git
   cd Stock-Prediction-Model
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it by scaling the prices.
2. Split the data into training and test sets.
3. Build the RNN model using Keras.
4. Train the model on the training set.
5. Predict stock prices on the test set and visualize the results.

### Example Code to Train the Model
```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
```

## Model Architecture
The RNN model consists of:
- Three LSTM layers with Dropout regularization
- One output layer for price prediction

### Model Summary
```python
model.summary()
```

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
